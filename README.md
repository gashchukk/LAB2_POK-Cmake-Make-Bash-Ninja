  3. Install bash, CLI shell

  4. C++ compiler must be installed (obviously)
</mark>

### Compilation

<mark>
  for cmake:
➜  mystring git:(cmake) ✗ cmake -B build
  
➜  mystring git:(cmake) ✗ cd build

build git:(cmake) ✗ cmake ..

➜  build git:(cmake) ✗ make


  for bash:

  
    bash compile.sh
    

</mark>


### Usage

<mark>
make usage:

  1. go to directory ./library

  2. open and compile makefile by command: make

  3. then go to directory ./examples

  4. by the analogy: open and compile makefile by command: make

  5. launching executable files

bash usage:


  just write in terminal command:
  
        bash compile.sh 

cmake usage:

  1. from directory lab2-make-cmake-shumskyi_hashchuk_arnauta go to mystring and then to libarary directory

  2. open CMakeLists.txt

  3. then write these commands:
      ➜  mystring git:(cmake) ✗ cmake -B build

      ➜  mystring git:(cmake) ✗ cd build

      ➜  build git:(cmake) ✗ make

      ➜  build git:(cmake) ✗ cmake ..

      ➜  build git:(cmake) ✗ make -j8

      ➜  build git:(cmake) ✗ cd examples 

      ➜  examples git:(cmake) ✗ ./main 
  
</mark>
